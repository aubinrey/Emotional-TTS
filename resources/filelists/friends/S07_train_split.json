The nominees for Best Supporting Actress are: from Passions: Erin Goff.  From One Life to Live: Mary Loren Bishop , from All My Children: Sarah McCann, and from Days of Our Lives: Jessica Ashley. And the winner is  Jessica Ashley from Days of Our Lives.  Uh, unfortunately Jessica couldn't be with us tonight, so I'll be accepting this award on her behalf.  And I'm sure that Jessica would like to thank my parents who always believed in me. She'd also like to thank my friends, Chandler, Monica, Ross, Phoebe, and Rachel, who's sittin' right there!  "
