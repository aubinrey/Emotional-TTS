# TTS without Emotions

## Project Overview

This project, "TTS without Emotions," is a text-to-speech (TTS) system that focuses on generating speech without emotional nuances. The project repository includes code, checkpoints, and resources related to the development of this TTS system.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:

- **.vscode:** Configuration files for Visual Studio Code.
- **checkpts:** Checkpoints related to the TTS model.
- **hifi-gan:** Code or resources related to High Fidelity Generative Adversarial Networks (HiFi-GAN).
- **logs/new_exp:** Log files for a new experiment.
- **model:** TTS model files.
- **resources:** Additional project resources.
- **text:** Text data used in the project.

## Project Files

- **.gitignore:** Git configuration to ignore specific files and directories.
- **come_on_exbcp.mp3:** Example audio file.
- **convert_sr.py:** Python script for converting speech rate.
- **data.py:** Python script for handling data-related tasks.
- **inference.ipynb:** Jupyter Notebook for TTS inference.
- **inference.py:** Python script for TTS inference.
- **loss_data.csv:** CSV file containing loss data.
- **params.py:** Configuration file for project parameters.
- **requirements.txt:** List of project dependencies.
- **split.py:** Python script for data splitting.
- **train.py:** Python script for training the TTS model.
- **train_multi_speaker.py:** Python script for multi-speaker TTS training.
- **utils.py:** Utility functions used in the project.

## Usage

To use the project, follow these general steps:

1. Ensure you have the required dependencies by checking the `requirements.txt` file.
2. Explore the project files and directories to understand the structure.
3. Refer to specific scripts (e.g., `train.py`, `inference.py`) for executing different tasks.
4. Experiment with the provided example audio file (`come_on_exbcp.mp3`).
5. Adjust parameters in `params.py` to customize the TTS model according to your requirements.
